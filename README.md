# Lab Phoenix Web app
The goal of this lab to familiarize myself with `Elixir` in general and with it's popular web framework `Phoenix'.

# Goals
- Create a `Phoenix` app from scratch
	- investigate how to read env variables in elixir
	- more specifically I had problem with ecto not able to read env variables with `System.get_env\1`
- Add some logic (maybe fetch some data from some public API) to the app, and then display it in some view
- Add authentication and authorization
